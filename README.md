# Daily Push-up Challenge

A simple web application that helps you track your daily push-up challenge. The number of push-ups you need to do each day corresponds to the day of the year (e.g., on day 100, you do 100 push-ups).

## Features

- 📅 Automatically calculates your daily push-up target based on the current day of the year
- 📊 Visual progress tracking with a GitHub-style activity chart
- 📱 Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- 💪 Progressive overload principle for steady strength building
- 📈 Tracks total push-ups completed throughout the year

## How It Works

The challenge follows a simple progressive overload principle:

- Day 1 of the year: Do 1 push-up
- Day 2 of the year: Do 2 push-ups
- Day 100 of the year: Do 100 push-ups
- And so on...

The activity chart shows your daily progress with darker colors representing more push-ups for that day.
